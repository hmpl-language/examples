# List of sample applications on HMPL

This repository contains a list of test applications written using the HMPL template language. You can safely take them and modify them (only the pictures need to be replaced).

## Gallery App

A flower gallery application with pagination functionality. The images, as well as the name of the application itself, are uploaded from the server.
